        "heroDescription": "Bowen Therapy is a holistic, non-invasive bodywork technique that encourages the body's innate ability to heal itself. Through subtle, precise movements, it aims to reset the body's balance, reduce pain, and restore overall harmony.",

        "introWhatIsTitle": "What is Bowen Therapy?",
        "introWhatIsText": "Bowen Therapy, also known as Bowenwork or Bowtech, is a gentle, non-invasive, and holistic soft tissue therapy. It involves a series of subtle rolling moves performed with thumbs and fingers over specific muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia. Unlike other manual therapies, it does not involve forceful manipulation, deep pressure, or cracking joints. Its philosophy emphasizes 'Less is More,' believing that minimal, precise inputs can trigger profound self-healing responses in the body.",
        "introOriginsTitle": "Origins and Philosophy",
        "introOriginsText": "Developed by Australian Thomas Ambrose Bowen (1916-1982) in the 1950s, Bowen Therapy emerged from his deep understanding of the human body. Tom Bowen claimed to treat over 13,000 people per year by the 1970s, establishing his reputation largely by word-of-mouth. His technique was based on the belief that the body, given the right conditions and signals, possesses an inherent capacity to heal itself. The therapy is a holistic approach, treating the individual as a whole—body, mind, and soul—rather than focusing solely on specific symptoms.",
        "introHowPromotesTitle": "How It Promotes Healing",
        "introHowPromotesText": "Bowen Therapy works by sending precise signals to the nervous system, particularly influencing the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS). It aims to shift the body from a state of sympathetic dominance ('fight, flight, or freeze' mode) to parasympathetic dominance ('rest, relax, and repair' mode). This shift allows the body to release tension, reduce inflammation, improve circulation, and activate its innate healing intelligence to restore balance (homeostasis). The unique 'pauses' during a session are crucial for the body to integrate these signals and initiate its self-healing processes.",

        "sessionStep1Title": "Consultation & Preparation",
        "sessionStep1Text": "Your first session typically lasts 60-90 minutes. We'll discuss your medical history, current symptoms, and goals. Wear light, loose-fitting clothing, as moves can be done through clothes. Hydration is key: drink plenty of water in the days leading up to your session. Avoid other bodywork (massage, chiropractic) for a few days prior to ensure the best results.",
        "sessionStep2Title": "Gentle Moves & The Crucial Pause",
        "sessionStep2Text": "You'll lie on a therapy bed (or sit in a chair if preferred). The therapist applies gentle, rolling moves with thumbs and fingers to specific points on your body. After each set of moves, the therapist will leave the room for 2-5 minutes.

        "sessionStep3Title": "The Healing Response",
        "sessionStep3Text": "During and after the session, your body enters a state of deep relaxation, shifting to a 'rest and repair' mode. You may experience subtle sensations (tingling, warmth, mild aches) as your body reorganizes. This is a positive sign that the treatment is taking effect and your body's innate healing intelligence is activated.",
        "sessionStep4Title": "Post-Session Integration & Aftercare",
        "sessionStep4Text": "The healing process continues for 5-7 days after your session. It's vital to stay hydrated, engage in light movement (avoid prolonged sitting), and avoid other manipulative therapies or extreme temperatures (hot/cold packs, hot baths) for at least 48 hours to allow your body to fully integrate the treatment's effects. The number of sessions varies, but often 2-3 sessions spaced a week apart yield significant improvements.",

        "evidenceScientificTitle": "The Scientific Evidence",
        "evidenceScientificIntro": "The scientific community acknowledges a limited body of high-quality scientific research on Bowen Therapy. A 2015 review by the Australian Government's Department of Health found no clear evidence of its effectiveness as a medical intervention. Similarly, the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) only accepts claims for stress/anxiety relief and short-term hamstring flexibility, requiring robust clinical evidence for broader claims. Critics like PainScience.com describe the scientific basis as 'flimsy at best' and the mechanisms as 'murky, if not incoherent.'

        "faqIntro": "Here you'll find answers to some of the most common questions about Bowen Therapy, covering what it is, how it works, what to expect, and its benefits.",
        "faqCategoryGeneral": "General Questions",
        "faqQ1": "What is Bowen Therapy?",
        "faqA1": "Bowen Therapy is a gentle, holistic, and non-invasive bodywork technique consisting of a series of subtle moves over muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia. It works by sending signals to the nervous system to help the body reset and heal itself, without forceful manipulation.",
        "faqQ2": "What can Bowen Therapy help with?",
        "faqA2": "Bowen Therapy is used for a wide range of conditions, including musculoskeletal pain (back, neck, shoulder, knee issues), chronic pain conditions like fibromyalgia, stress and anxiety, fatigue, headaches/migraines, digestive issues, and respiratory problems. It also supports women's health, pediatric issues, and recovery from injury or surgery.",
        "faqQ3": "How does Bowen Therapy work?",
        "faqA3": "It works by stimulating the body's Autonomic Nervous System (ANS), encouraging a shift from 'fight or flight' to 'rest and repair'. This facilitates relaxation, reduces muscle tension, improves circulation, and activates the body’s self-healing mechanisms. Bowen moves also affect fascia and proprioceptors.",
        "faqQ4": "What does a typical session involve?",
        "faqA4": "A session typically lasts 45-60 minutes. The client lies on a massage table or sits in a chair. The therapist makes gentle rolling moves over specific points, followed by pauses, allowing the body to integrate the signals. Clients often experience deep relaxation.",
        "faqQ5": "What should I wear for a session?",
        "faqA5": "Light, loose-fitting clothing is recommended, as Bowen moves can be performed through clothing. However, moves can also be performed directly on skin if preferred.",
        "faqCategorySession": "Session Experience & Aftercare",
        "faqQ6": "What will I feel during a session?",
        "faqA6": "Many clients experience deep relaxation, sometimes falling asleep. You might feel subtle sensations like tingling, warmth, or mild aches as the body responds. These are often signs of the body initiating its healing process.",
        "faqQ7": "What is a 'healing response' or 'aggravation'?",
        "faqA7": "These are temporary reactions that indicate the body is processing the treatment. They might include temporary aches or stiffness in treated or new areas, fatigue, mild flu-like symptoms (attributed to toxin release), emotional releases, or increased thirst. These are usually mild and short-lived.",
        "faqQ8": "How many sessions will I need?",
        "faqA8": "Many conditions respond within 2-3 sessions, often spaced about a week apart. Chronic or long-standing issues may require more sessions. Your therapist will discuss a treatment plan with you.",
        "faqQ9": "Why the 'pauses' during the session?",
        "faqA9": "The pauses are a unique and crucial aspect of Bowen Therapy. They allow the body time to process the gentle signals given by the moves, initiate its own adjustments, and shift into a 'rest and repair' state without interference.",
        "faqQ10": "Is Bowen Therapy safe for pregnant women?",
        "faqA10": "Yes, Bowen Therapy is very gentle and considered safe for pregnant women at all stages. It can effectively address common pregnancy discomforts like back pain, sciatica, and swelling.",
        "faqCategoryNot": "What Bowen Therapy is NOT",
        "faqQ11": "Is Bowen Therapy a type of massage?",
        "faqA11": "No, Bowen Therapy is distinct from massage. It involves very light, specific rolling moves rather than deep tissue manipulation or prolonged rubbing. The practitioner often leaves the room between sets of moves, allowing the body to process.",
        "faqQ12": "Is Bowen Therapy like chiropractic or osteopathy?",
        "faqA12": "No, Bowen Therapy does not involve any forceful manipulation, cracking, or adjustment of bones or joints. It works on the soft tissues (muscles, fascia) to encourage the body to make its own gentle realignments.",
        "faqQ13": "Does it diagnose or treat specific conditions?",
        "faqA13": "Bowen Therapy is a holistic complementary therapy that facilitates the body’s innate healing. Practitioners do not diagnose or treat medical conditions. It is recommended to consult a doctor for diagnosis and medical treatment.",
        "faqCategoryPractitioner": "Practitioner & Safety",
        "faqQ14": "How do I find a qualified Bowen Therapist?",
        "faqA14": "It is important to choose a therapist who has completed accredited training and is typically registered with a professional association in their country. Look for qualifications, professional insurance, and adherence to a code of conduct.",
        "faqQ15": "Are there any contraindications or situations to be cautious about?",
        "faqA15": "Bowen Therapy is very safe.

Always inform your therapist of your full medical history.",
        "faqQ16": "Can Bowen Therapy be combined with other therapies?",
        "faqA16": "It is generally recommended to avoid other manipulative therapies (like massage, chiropractic, physiotherapy) for 5-7 days after a Bowen session to allow the body to fully integrate the work. Other gentle therapies, like acupuncture, might be acceptable, but always discuss with your Bowen therapist.",
        "faqQ17": "Does Bowen Therapy replace medical care?",
        "faqA17": "No, Bowen Therapy is a complementary modality and is not intended to replace conventional medical diagnosis or treatment. Always consult with your doctor or a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns and appropriate treatment options.",

        "faqA19": "Yes, Bowen Therapy is frequently used to support individuals with chronic conditions such as fibromyalgia, MS, Parkinson's, and long-standing pain.

        "faqQ20": "Is there scientific evidence for Bowen Therapy?",
        "faqA20": "While a large body of high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is still developing, preliminary research and smaller studies suggest promising areas, particularly for stress reduction, pain management, and flexibility. Patient testimonials also consistently report positive outcomes. It's important to note regulatory bodies may have specific guidelines on claims.",
        "faqQ21": "Can children and babies receive Bowen Therapy?",
        "faqA21": "Yes, Bowen Therapy is extremely gentle and effective for children and babies, often with very quick results due to their highly responsive systems. It can help with conditions like colic, reflux, sleep issues, bedwetting, and developmental challenges.",
        "faqQ22": "What are the 'rules' for after a Bowen session?",
        "faqA22": "Aftercare is crucial. It includes staying well-hydrated, engaging in gentle movement (avoiding prolonged sitting/lying), avoiding other manipulative therapies for 5-7 days, avoiding extreme temperatures (hot/cold packs, hot baths) for 48 hours, and communicating any 'healing responses' to your therapist. These guidelines help maximize the treatment's effectiveness.",

Tom Bowen a susținut că trata peste 13.000 de persoane pe an până în anii 1970, stabilindu-și reputația în mare parte prin recomandări verbale. Tehnica sa se baza pe convingerea că organismul, în condițiile și cu semnalele potrivite, posedă o capacitate înnăscută de a se vindeca. Terapia este o abordare holistică, tratând individul ca un întreg – corp, minte și suflet – mai degrabă decât concentrându-se doar pe simptome specifice.",
        "introHowPromotesTitle": "Cum Promovează Vindecarea",
        "introHowPromotesText": "Terapia Bowen acționează prin trimiterea de semnale precise către sistemul nervos, influențând în special Sistemul Nervos Autonom (SNA). Scopul este de a schimba corpul dintr-o stare de dominanță simpatică ('luptă, fugi sau îngheață') într-o dominanță parasimpatică ('odihnă, relaxare și reparare'). Această schimbare permite corpului să elibereze tensiunea, să reducă inflamația, să îmbunătățească circulația și să-și activeze inteligența înnăscută de vindecare pentru a restabili echilibrul (homeostazia). 'Pauzele' unice din timpul unei sesiuni sunt cruciale pentru ca organismul să integreze aceste semnale și să-și inițieze procesele de auto-vindecare.",

        "faqQ16": "Poate fi combinată Terapia Bowen cu alte terapii?",
        "faqA16": "În general, se recomandă evitarea altor terapii manipulative (cum ar fi masajul, chiropraxia, fizioterapia) timp de 5-7 zile după o sesiune Bowen pentru a permite corpului să integreze pe deplin lucrul. Alte terapii blânde, cum ar fi acupunctura, ar putea fi acceptabile, dar discutați întotdeauna cu terapeutul dumneavoastră Bowen.",
        "faqQ17": "Terapia Bowen înlocuiește îngrijirea medicală?",
        "faqA17": "Nu, Terapia Bowen este o modalitate complementară și nu este menită să înlocuiască diagnosticul sau tratamentul medical convențional. Consultați întotdeauna medicul dumneavoastră sau un profesionist calificat din domeniul sănătății pentru orice problemă de sănătate și opțiuni de tratament adecvate.",
        "faqQ18": "Ce fel de pregătire au Terapeuții Bowen?",
        "faqA18": "Terapeuții Bowen calificați finalizează programe de pregătire acreditate de la instituții recunoscute (de ex., Bowtech, ECBS, Academia Americană Bowen). Aceasta implică de obicei un studiu cuprinzător al tehnicilor Bowen, anatomiei și fiziologiei, primului ajutor, și respectarea standardelor profesionale și a dezvoltării profesionale continue (DPC).",
        "faqQ19": "Poate Terapia Bowen ajuta la afecțiunile cronice?",
        "faqA19": "Da, Terapia Bowen este frecvent utilizată pentru a susține persoanele cu afecțiuni cronice precum fibromialgia, SM, Parkinson și dureri de lungă durată. Deși s-ar putea să nu vindece afecțiunea, adesea ajută la gestionarea simptomelor, la reducerea durerii, la îmbunătățirea mobilității și la îmbunătățirea calității generale a vieții.",
        "faqQ20": "Există dovezi științifice pentru Terapia Bowen?",
        "faqA20": "Deși un corp mare de studii controlate randomizate (RCT) de înaltă calitate este încă în dezvoltare, cercetările preliminare și studiile mai mici sugerează domenii promițătoare, în special pentru reducerea stresului, gestionarea durerii și flexibilitate. Mărturiile pacienților raportează, de asemenea, în mod constant rezultate pozitive. Este important de reținut că organismele de reglementare pot avea linii directoare specifice privind afirmațiile.",
        "faqQ21": "Copiii și bebelușii pot beneficia de Terapia Bowen?",
        "faqA21": "Da, Terapia Bowen este extrem de blândă și eficientă pentru copii și bebeluși, adesea cu rezultate foarte rapide datorită sistemelor lor foarte receptive. Poate ajuta la afecțiuni precum colici, reflux, probleme de somn, enurezis nocturn și provocări de dezvoltare.",
        "faqQ22": "Care sunt 'regulile' după o sesiune Bowen?",
        "faqA22": "Îngrijirea ulterioară este crucială. Include menținerea unei hidratări bune, efectuarea de mișcări blânde (evitarea șederii/întinsului prelungit), evitarea altor terapii manipulative timp de 5-7 zile, evitarea temperaturilor extreme (comprese fierbinți/reci, băi fierbinți) timp de 48 de ore și comunicarea oricăror 'răspunsuri de vindecare' terapeutului dumneavoastră. Aceste ghiduri ajută la maximizarea eficacității tratamentului.",

        "sessionStep1Text": "Prima sesiune durează de obicei 60-90 de minute. Vom discuta istoricul dumneavoastră medical, simptomele actuale și obiectivele. Purtați haine ușoare, largi, deoarece mișcările se pot face prin haine. Hidratarea este cheia: beți multă apă în zilele premergătoare sesiunii. Evitați alte terapii corporale (masaj, chiropractică) cu câteva zile înainte pentru a asigura cele mai bune rezultate.",
        "sessionStep2Title": "Mișcări Blânde și Pauza Crucială",
        "sessionStep2Text": "Veți sta culcat pe o masă de terapie (sau așezat pe un scaun, dacă preferați). Terapeutul aplică mișcări blânde, de rulare, cu degetele mari și arătătoare în puncte specifice ale corpului. După fiecare set de mișcări, terapeutul va părăsi camera pentru 2-5 minute. Această 'pauză crucială' permite corpului să integreze semnalele și să-și inițieze procesele de auto-vindecare fără interferențe.",
        "sessionStep3Title": "Răspunsul de Vindecare",
        "sessionStep3Text": "În timpul și după sesiune, corpul intră într-o stare de relaxare profundă, trecând într-un mod de 'odihnă și reparare'. Puteți experimenta senzații subtile (furnicături, căldură, dureri ușoare) pe măsură ce corpul se reorganizează. Acesta este un semn pozitiv că tratamentul își face efectul și inteligența înnăscută de vindecare a corpului este activată.",
        "sessionStep4Title": "Integrarea Post-Sesiune și Îngrijirea Post-Terapie",
        "sessionStep4Text": "Procesul de vindecare continuă timp de 5-7 zile după sesiune. Este vital să rămâneți hidratat, să faceți mișcare ușoară (evitați statul prelungit), și să evitați alte terapii manipulative sau temperaturi extreme (comprese calde/reci, băi fierbinți) timp de cel puțin 48 de ore pentru a permite corpului să integreze pe deplin efectele tratamentului. Numărul de sesiuni variază, dar adesea 2-3 sesiuni la o săptămână distanță aduc îmbunătățiri semnificative.",

        "introWhatIsText": "Bowen Therapie, ook bekend als Bowenwork of Bowtech, is een zachte, niet-invasieve en holistische bindweefseltherapie. Het omvat een reeks subtiele rollende bewegingen die met duimen en vingers over specifieke spieren, pezen, ligamenten en fascia worden uitgevoerd. In tegenstelling tot andere manuele therapieën omvat het geen krachtige manipulatie, diepe druk of het kraken van gewrichten. De filosofie benadrukt 'Minder is Meer', in de overtuiging dat minimale, precieze inputs diepgaande zelfgenezingsreacties in het lichaam kunnen triggeren.",
        "introOriginsTitle": "Oorsprong en Filosofie",
        "introOriginsText": "Ontwikkeld door de Australiër Thomas Ambrose Bowen (1916-1982) in de jaren 1950, kwam Bowen Therapie voort uit zijn diepgaande begrip van het menselijk lichaam. Tom Bowen beweerde in de jaren 70 meer dan 13.000 mensen per jaar te behandelen en vestigde zijn reputatie grotendeels via mond-tot-mondreclame. Zijn techniek was gebaseerd op de overtuiging dat het lichaam, mits de juiste omstandigheden en signalen, een inherent vermogen tot zelfgenezing bezit. De therapie is een holistische benadering, waarbij het individu als geheel wordt behandeld — lichaam, geest en ziel — in plaats van zich uitsluitend te richten op specifieke symptomen.",
        "introHowPromotesTitle": "Hoe Het Genezing Bevordert",
        "introHowPromotesText": "Bowen Therapie werkt door precieze signalen naar het zenuwstelsel te sturen, met name het Autonome Zenuwstelsel (AZS) te beïnvloeden. Het is gericht op het verschuiven van het lichaam van een staat van sympathische dominantie ('vecht-, vlucht- of bevriesmodus') naar parasympathische dominantie ('rust-, herstel- en reparatiemodus'). Deze verschuiving stelt het lichaam in staat om spanning los te laten, ontstekingen te verminderen, de circulatie te verbeteren en de inherente genezingsintelligentie te activeren om het evenwicht (homeostase) te herstellen. De unieke 'pauzes' tijdens een sessie zijn cruciaal voor het lichaam om deze signalen te integreren en de zelfgenezingsprocessen te initiëren.",

        "sessionStep1Text": "Uw eerste sessie duurt meestal 60-90 minuten. We bespreken uw medische geschiedenis, huidige symptomen en doelen. Draag lichte, loszittende kleding, aangezien bewegingen door kleding heen kunnen worden uitgevoerd. Hydratatie is cruciaal: drink de dagen voorafgaand aan uw sessie veel water. Vermijd andere lichaamswerk (massage, chiropractie) een paar dagen van tevoren om de beste resultaten te garanderen.",

De therapeut past zachte, rollende bewegingen met duimen en vingers toe op specifieke punten op uw lichaam. Na elke reeks bewegingen verlaat de therapeut de kamer voor 2-5 minuten. Deze 'cruciale pauze' stelt uw lichaam in staat de signalen te integreren en de zelfgenezingsprocessen te initiëren zonder verstoring.",

        "sessionStep3Text": "Tijdens en na de sessie komt uw lichaam in een staat van diepe ontspanning, overschakelend naar een 'rust- en herstelmodus'.

        "faqSubtitle": "Antwoorden op veelvoorkomende vragen over Bowen Therapie.",
        "faqIntro": "Hier vindt u antwoorden op enkele van de meest gestelde vragen over Bowen Therapie, inclusief wat het is, hoe het werkt, wat u kunt verwachten en de voordelen ervan.",
        "faqCategoryGeneral": "Algemene Vragen",
        "faqQ1": "Wat is Bowen Therapie?",
        "faqA1": "Bowen Therapie is een zachte, holistische en niet-invasieve lichaamsgerichte techniek, bestaande uit een reeks subtiele bewegingen over spieren, pezen, ligamenten en fascia. Het werkt door signalen naar het zenuwstelsel te sturen om het lichaam te helpen zichzelf te resetten en te genezen, zonder geforceerde manipulatie.",
        "faqQ2": "Waarbij kan Bowen Therapie helpen?",
        "faqA2": "Bowen Therapie wordt gebruikt voor een breed scala aan aandoeningen, waaronder musculoskeletale pijn (rug-, nek-, schouder- en knieproblemen), chronische pijn zoals fibromyalgie, stress en angst, vermoeidheid, hoofdpijn/migraine, spijsverteringsproblemen en ademhalingsproblemen. Het ondersteunt ook de gezondheid van vrouwen, kinderproblemen en herstel na letsel of operaties.",
        "faqQ3": "Hoe werkt Bowen Therapie?",
        "faqA3": "Het werkt door het Autonome Zenuwstelsel (AZS) van het lichaam te stimuleren, waardoor een verschuiving van de 'vecht- of vlucht'-modus naar de 'rust- en herstel'-modus wordt aangemoedigd. Deze verschuiving vergemakkelijkt ontspanning, vermindert spierspanning, verbetert de bloedsomloop en activeert de zelfgenezingsmechanismen van het lichaam. Bowen-bewegingen beïnvloeden ook de fascia en proprioceptoren.",
        "faqQ4": "Wat houdt een typische sessie in?",
        "faqA4": "Een sessie duurt meestal 45-60 minuten. De cliënt ligt op een massagetafel of zit op een stoel. De therapeut maakt zachte, rollende bewegingen over specifieke punten, gevolgd door pauzes, waardoor het lichaam de signalen kan integreren. Cliënten ervaren vaak diepe ontspanning.",
        "faqQ5": "Wat moet ik dragen tijdens een sessie?",
        "faqA5": "Draag bij voorkeur losse, comfortabele kleding, omdat Bowen bewegingen vaak over kleding heen kunnen worden uitgevoerd. Indien gewenst kunnen de bewegingen ook direct op de huid worden toegepast.",
        "faqCategorySession": "Sessie-ervaring en Nazorg",
        "faqQ6": "Wat voel ik tijdens een sessie?",
        "faqA6": "Veel cliënten ervaren diepe ontspanning en vallen soms zelfs in slaap. U kunt subtiele sensaties voelen zoals tintelingen, warmte of lichte pijn terwijl het lichaam reageert. Dit zijn vaak tekenen dat het genezingsproces begint.",
        "faqQ7": "Wat is een 'geneesreactie' of 'verergering'?",
        "faqA7": "Dit zijn tijdelijke reacties die aangeven dat het lichaam het werk verwerkt. Ze kunnen bestaan uit tijdelijke pijn of stijfheid, vermoeidheid, lichte griepachtige symptomen (door het vrijkomen van toxines), emotionele ontladingen of toegenomen dorst. Ze zijn meestal mild en van korte duur.",
        "faqQ8": "Hoeveel sessies heb ik nodig?",
        "faqA8": "Veel klachten verbeteren in 2-3 sessies, vaak met ongeveer een week ertussen. Chronische of langdurige klachten kunnen meer sessies vergen. Uw therapeut zal dit met u bespreken.",
        "faqQ9": "Waarom zijn er 'pauzes' tijdens de sessie?",
        "faqA9": "De pauzes zijn een uniek en essentieel onderdeel van Bowen Therapie. Ze geven het lichaam de tijd om de subtiele signalen van de bewegingen te verwerken, zich aan te passen en in een 'rust- en herstelmodus' te komen.",
        "faqQ10": "Is Bowen Therapie veilig tijdens de zwangerschap?",
        "faqA10": "Ja, Bowen Therapie is zeer zacht en wordt als veilig beschouwd voor zwangere vrouwen in alle stadia. Het kan effectief verlichting bieden bij typische zwangerschapsklachten zoals rugpijn, ischias en zwellingen.",
        "faqCategoryNot": "Wat Bowen Therapie Niet Is",
        "faqQ11": "Is Bowen Therapie een vorm van massage?",
        "faqA11": "Nee, Bowen Therapie is anders dan massage. Het omvat zeer lichte, specifieke rollende bewegingen, in plaats van diepe weefselmanipulatie of langdurige wrijving. De therapeut verlaat vaak de kamer tussen de bewegingensets zodat het lichaam ze kan verwerken.",
        "faqQ12": "Is Bowen Therapie vergelijkbaar met chiropractie of osteopathie?",
        "faqA12": "Nee, Bowen Therapie omvat geen geforceerde manipulaties, kraken of aanpassingen van botten of gewrichten. Het werkt op zacht weefsel (spieren, fascia) om het lichaam te stimuleren zichzelf zachtjes opnieuw uit te lijnen.",
        "faqQ13": "Diagnosticeert of behandelt het specifieke aandoeningen?",
        "faqA13": "Bowen Therapie is een holistische, complementaire therapie die het natuurlijke genezingsvermogen van het lichaam ondersteunt. Therapeuten stellen geen diagnoses en behandelen geen medische aandoeningen. Raadpleeg altijd een arts voor diagnose en medische behandeling.",
        "faqCategoryPractitioner": "Therapeut & Veiligheid",
        "faqQ14": "Hoe vind ik een gekwalificeerde Bowen Therapeut?",
        "faqA14": "Het is belangrijk om een therapeut te kiezen die een erkende opleiding heeft voltooid en doorgaans is aangesloten bij een beroepsvereniging in zijn of haar land. Let op kwalificaties, beroepsverzekering en naleving van een gedragscode.",
        "faqQ15": "Zijn er contra-indicaties of situaties om rekening mee te houden?",
        "faqA15": "Bowen Therapie is zeer veilig. Toch zijn er situaties die voorzichtigheid of aanpassing vereisen, zoals intoxicatie, koorts, diepe veneuze trombose (DVT), bepaalde vormen van kanker (vooral in het lymfesysteem) en een aorta-aneurysma. Informeer uw therapeut altijd over uw volledige medische geschiedenis.",
        "faqQ16": "Kan Bowen Therapie gecombineerd worden met andere therapieën?",
        "faqA16": "Over het algemeen wordt aangeraden om andere manipulatietherapieën (zoals massage, chiropractie, fysiotherapie) 5-7 dagen na een Bowen sessie te vermijden om het lichaam de tijd te geven het werk volledig te integreren. Andere zachte therapieën zoals acupunctuur kunnen acceptabel zijn, maar overleg altijd met uw Bowen therapeut.",
        "faqQ17": "Vervangt Bowen Therapie medische zorg?",
        "faqA17": "Nee, Bowen Therapie is een aanvullende methode en is niet bedoeld als vervanging voor medische diagnose of behandeling. Raadpleeg altijd uw arts of een gekwalificeerde zorgverlener voor gezondheidsproblemen en behandelmogelijkheden.",
        "faqQ18": "Welke opleiding hebben Bowen Therapeuten?",
        "faqA18": "Gekwalificeerde Bowen Therapeuten hebben een erkend opleidingsprogramma afgerond bij erkende instellingen (zoals Bowtech, ECBS, American Bowen Academy). Dit omvat meestal uitgebreide studie van Bowen technieken, anatomie en fysiologie, eerste hulp, en naleving van professionele normen en permanente bijscholing (CPD).",
        "faqQ19": "Kan Bowen Therapie helpen bij chronische aandoeningen?",
        "faqA19": "Ja, Bowen Therapie wordt vaak gebruikt ter ondersteuning van mensen met chronische aandoeningen zoals fibromyalgie, MS, Parkinson en langdurige pijn. Hoewel het de aandoening mogelijk niet geneest, helpt het vaak bij symptoomverlichting, pijnvermindering, verbeterde mobiliteit en een betere levenskwaliteit.",
        "faqQ20": "Is er wetenschappelijk bewijs voor Bowen Therapie?",
        "faqA20": "Hoewel er nog gewerkt wordt aan een grotere hoeveelheid kwalitatief hoogwaardig onderzoek (RCT's), tonen voorlopige studies en kleinere onderzoeken veelbelovende resultaten, met name op het gebied van stressvermindering, pijnbeheer en flexibiliteit. Cliëntenrapporten geven ook consequent positieve resultaten aan. Houd er rekening mee dat toezichthoudende instanties specifieke richtlijnen kunnen hebben over wat mag worden geclaimd.",
        "faqQ21": "Kunnen kinderen en baby’s baat hebben bij Bowen Therapie?",
        "faqA21": "Ja, Bowen Therapie is uiterst zacht en effectief voor kinderen en baby’s, vaak met zeer snelle resultaten dankzij hun gevoelige systemen. Het kan helpen bij klachten zoals koliek, reflux, slaapproblemen, bedplassen en ontwikkelingsproblemen.",
        "faqQ22": "Wat zijn de 'regels' na een Bowen sessie?",
        "faqA22": "Nazorg is essentieel. Dit omvat voldoende hydratatie, lichte beweging (vermijd langdurig zitten/liggen), geen andere manipulatietherapieën gedurende 5-7 dagen, het vermijden van extreme temperaturen (hete/koude kompressen, hete baden) gedurende 48 uur en het melden van eventuele 'geneesreacties' aan uw therapeut. Deze richtlijnen helpen de effectiviteit van de behandeling te maximaliseren.",

        "heroDescription": "Bowen Therapy is a holistic, non-invasive bodywork technique that encourages the body's innate ability to heal itself. Through subtle, precise movements, it aims to reset the body's balance, reduce pain, and restore overall harmony.",

        "introWhatIsTitle": "What is Bowen Therapy?",
        "introWhatIsText": "Bowen Therapy, also known as Bowenwork or Bowtech, is a gentle, non-invasive, and holistic soft tissue therapy. It involves a series of subtle rolling moves performed with thumbs and fingers over specific muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia. Unlike other manual therapies, it does not involve forceful manipulation, deep pressure, or cracking joints. Its philosophy emphasizes 'Less is More,' believing that minimal, precise inputs can trigger profound self-healing responses in the body.",
        "introOriginsTitle": "Origins and Philosophy",
        "introOriginsText": "Developed by Australian Thomas Ambrose Bowen (1916-1982) in the 1950s, Bowen Therapy emerged from his deep understanding of the human body. Tom Bowen claimed to treat over 13,000 people per year by the 1970s, establishing his reputation largely by word-of-mouth. His technique was based on the belief that the body, given the right conditions and signals, possesses an inherent capacity to heal itself. The therapy is a holistic approach, treating the individual as a whole—body, mind, and soul—rather than focusing solely on specific symptoms.",
        "introHowPromotesTitle": "How It Promotes Healing",
        "introHowPromotesText": "Bowen Therapy works by sending precise signals to the nervous system, particularly influencing the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS). It aims to shift the body from a state of sympathetic dominance ('fight, flight, or freeze' mode) to parasympathetic dominance ('rest, relax, and repair' mode). This shift allows the body to release tension, reduce inflammation, improve circulation, and activate its innate healing intelligence to restore balance (homeostasis). The unique 'pauses' during a session are crucial for the body to integrate these signals and initiate its self-healing processes.",

        "sessionStep1Text": "Your first session typically lasts 60-90 minutes. We'll discuss your medical history, current symptoms, and goals. Wear light, loose-fitting clothing, as moves can be done through clothes. Hydration is key: drink plenty of water in the days leading up to your session.

        "sessionStep2Title": "Gentle Moves & The Crucial Pause",
        "sessionStep2Text": "You'll lie on a therapy bed (or sit in a chair if preferred). The therapist applies gentle, rolling moves with thumbs and fingers to specific points on your body.

        "introWhatIsText": "Terapia Bowen, cunoscută și sub denumirea de Bowenwork sau Bowtech, este o terapie blândă, non-invazivă și holistică a țesuturilor moi. Implică o serie de mișcări subtile de rulare, efectuate cu degetele mari și arătătoare peste anumiți mușchi, tendoane, ligamente și fascii. Spre deosebire de alte terapii manuale, nu implică manipulare forțată, presiune profundă sau trosnituri ale articulațiilor. Filosofia sa accentuează principiul 'Mai puțin înseamnă mai mult', crezând că intervențiile minime și precise pot declanșa răspunsuri profunde de auto-vindecare în corp.",
        "introOriginsTitle": "Origini și Filosofie",
        "introOriginsText": "Dezvoltată de australianul Thomas Ambrose Bowen (1916-1982) în anii 1950, Terapia Bowen a apărut din înțelegerea sa profundă a corpului uman. Tom Bowen a susținut că trata peste 13.000 de persoane pe an până în anii 1970, stabilindu-și reputația în mare parte prin recomandări verbale. Tehnica sa se baza pe convingerea că organismul, în condițiile și cu semnalele potrivite, posedă o capacitate înnăscută de a se vindeca. Terapia este o abordare holistică, tratând individul ca un întreg – corp, minte și suflet – mai degrabă decât concentrându-se doar pe simptome specifice.",
        "introHowPromotesTitle": "Cum Promovează Vindecarea",
        "introHowPromotesText": "Terapia Bowen acționează prin trimiterea de semnale precise către sistemul nervos, influențând în special Sistemul Nervos Autonom (SNA). Scopul este de a schimba corpul dintr-o stare de dominanță simpatică ('luptă, fugi sau îngheață') într-o dominanță parasimpatică ('odihnă, relaxare și reparare'). Această schimbare permite corpului să elibereze tensiunea, să reducă inflamația, să îmbunătățească circulația și să-și activeze inteligența înnăscută de vindecare pentru a restabili echilibrul (homeostazia). 'Pauzele' unice din timpul unei sesiuni sunt cruciale pentru ca organismul să integreze aceste semnale și să-și inițieze procesele de auto-vindecare.",

Door subtiele, precieze bewegingen probeert het de balans van het lichaam te herstellen, pijn te verminderen en algehele harmonie te herstellen.",

        "introWhatIsText": "Bowen Therapie, ook bekend als Bowenwork of Bowtech, is een zachte, niet-invasieve en holistische bindweefseltherapie. Het omvat een reeks subtiele rollende bewegingen die met duimen en vingers over specifieke spieren, pezen, ligamenten en fascia worden uitgevoerd. In tegenstelling tot andere manuele therapieën omvat het geen krachtige manipulatie, diepe druk of het kraken van gewrichten. De filosofie benadrukt 'Minder is Meer', in de overtuiging dat minimale, precieze inputs diepgaande zelfgenezingsreacties in het lichaam kunnen triggeren.",
        "introOriginsTitle": "Oorsprong en Filosofie",
        "introOriginsText": "Ontwikkeld door de Australiër Thomas Ambrose Bowen (1916-1982) in de jaren 1950, kwam Bowen Therapie voort uit zijn diepgaande begrip van het menselijk lichaam. Tom Bowen beweerde in de jaren 70 meer dan 13.000 mensen per jaar te behandelen en vestigde zijn reputatie grotendeels via mond-tot-mondreclame. Zijn techniek was gebaseerd op de overtuiging dat het lichaam, mits de juiste omstandigheden en signalen, een inherent vermogen tot zelfgenezing bezit. De therapie is een holistische benadering, waarbij het individu als geheel wordt behandeld — lichaam, geest en ziel — in plaats van zich uitsluitend te richten op specifieke symptomen.",
        "introHowPromotesTitle": "Hoe Het Genezing Bevordert",
        "introHowPromotesText": "Bowen Therapie werkt door precieze signalen naar het zenuwstelsel te sturen, met name het Autonome Zenuwstelsel (AZS) te beïnvloeden. Het is gericht op het verschuiven van het lichaam van een staat van sympathische dominantie ('vecht-, vlucht- of bevriesmodus') naar parasympathische dominantie ('rust-, herstel- en reparatiemodus'). Deze verschuiving stelt het lichaam in staat om spanning los te laten, ontstekingen te verminderen, de circulatie te verbeteren en de inherente genezingsintelligentie te activeren om het evenwicht (homeostase) te herstellen. De unieke 'pauzes' tijdens een sessie zijn cruciaal voor het lichaam om deze signalen te integreren en de zelfgenezingsprocessen te initiëren.",
